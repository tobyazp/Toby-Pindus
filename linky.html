    <h1>Jamie Vardy</h1>
    <p>Jamie Vardy is my favorite soccer player and hero. Being the ace of Leicester City, he historically led
        a freshly promoted Leicester City to the top of the Premier League table.
        Making his way up from the 5th division of English football he found great success after Leicesters promotion
        from the 2nd divison in the 2014-2015 season.
        The following year, Jamie Vardy proceeded to score a whopping 24 goals in an unsurpassed and historic season
        directly
        leading to Leicester taking the title.
