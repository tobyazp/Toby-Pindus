    <h1><em>Favorite Foods</em></h1>
    <p> First and foremost, I love a nice high quality burger with onion, swiss cheese, portobello mushrooms, bacon, and
        bbq sauce.
        When done well this burger not only makes my night but also my year. Asian food done correctly is absolutely out
        of this world.
        In LA I always go to this restaurant with the best fried rice, soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and popcorn
        chicken. It is absolutely delicious.
        Furthermore, I can pretty much eat Bibimbop every single day. Bibimbop is a rice based dish comprised of various
        vegetables and meat. It's delicious and healthy. For dessert, I love pretty much anything rich: Chocolate cake,
        brownies, cookies, it's all delicious to me.
    </p>

    <h1><em>Favorite Brands</em></h1>

    <p> My favorite brands have to be the ones that bring me the greatest use and joy. My favorite brand would have to
        be Nintendo
        for bringing me loveable games since I was a child. In terms of usage, my favorite brand would unfortunately
        have to be Apple.
        I pretty much use my mac and airpods every day. In terms of food brands I would have to give it to Trader Joes.
        Their snacks are incredibly delicious,
        and they have completely roped me into their world. Not to mention, their frozen food, dairy, meats, and cheese
        are far too good. I love how they import their
        products from various countries as well.
