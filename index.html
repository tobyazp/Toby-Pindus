    <h1> Hello, English 388 </h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Toby Pindus and I am a student at the University of Washington,
        Seattle studying Communication with a minor in Business and English.
        Through my academics, workout routines, and daily interactions,
        I am working every single day to improve myself as an individual both physically and mentally.
        As a Communication major, it may come as a surprise that I enjoy learning about data analytis and programming
        languages.
        Right now, I am learning the basics of R and HTML in this class.
        During my free time I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, playing video games,
        and hanging out with friends. In the future, I hope to realize
        my dream of creating my own comedic cartoon series on Adult Swim! For now, I am looking for jobs
        around the Los Angeles and San Diego area in a Marketing related position.</p>
